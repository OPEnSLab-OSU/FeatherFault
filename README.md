# FeatherFault

When a microcontroller crashes or hangs, it can be quite difficult to troubleshoot what caused it. FeatherFault is an attempt to build a system that can not only recover from a crash, but tell you why the crash happened. Goals of this project include:
 * Recovery from a hung project, hard fault, or stack overflow.
 * A method for determining what the reason for the last critical failure was *after* the failure happens, including a specific place in code.
 * Easy to use interface.
 
 This project is still in early stages, and this README will be updated as progress is made.
